  "about": "As a digital artist, I find the hidden things that modern technology obfuscates about ourselves and use code to expose them in their naked form through speculative software—repurposed and hacked applications meant to subvert the original intention of the technology. Presented as interactive installations, netart, video games, and hacked software, my work intends to upend the relationship between consumers of technology and the power structures that exploit them for data. \n\nI begin my work by asking what does my public data say about me as an individual and what does it say about our society collectively? The answers to these questions guide my approach as I dissect the mechanics of social media to transform mundane interactions into reflective experiences. My background in computer science allows me to engage deeply with the raw materials of computational media—i.e. code, electronics, and big data—to extrapolate alternate futures where users have ultimate agency over their personal data. \n\nSatire and post-truth are common themes in my work, such as Talkinghead (2019), in which virtual pundits mine political arguments from Reddit and Twitter to generate fake news commentary in real-time. Or, as in The True Cost of Things (2020), an imitation of the Instagram social network that intercepts mundane images and superimposes images of the environmental and social devastation that underlie the true material cost of our modern goods. Ultimately, my goal is to encourage honest reflection about the meaning of truth in the age of social media and how it might be algorithmically manipulated to tell alternative narratives. \n",
